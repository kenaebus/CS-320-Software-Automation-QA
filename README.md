<h1>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</h1><br><br>
Referencing requirements that are needed to understand the functionality of the software/program that I would develop and plan on those requirements.
<h1>How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?<br><br></h1>
Taking user stories and tests by conducting those interviews to better understand the user's vision and to further incorporate their needs into the requirements.
<h1>How do I approach designing software?</h1>
When first designing the software, best action taken is to have an outline of what is essentially needed, the essential requirements. Planning and working on those requirements, reviewing and conducting revisions whilst also implementing unit tests and cases to further improve the quality of the software.
